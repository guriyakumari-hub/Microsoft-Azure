# Azure CI/CD demo

This repository contains a minimal project (an `index.html`) and a simple GitHub Actions workflow to demonstrate CI on push/pull-request.

Getting started

- Initialize git (already done by the helper) and create a GitHub repository, or let the `gh` CLI create one for you.
- Push your `main` branch to GitHub and the workflow will run.

If you want me to create the remote repo and push from here, tell me and provide permission to use `gh` or provide the repo URL.
